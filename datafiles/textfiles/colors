+----- ~OL~FTColour Usage~RS

What you may not have known is that colour can be used just about ~FTanywhere~RS
you can think of!  If can be used in tells, shouts, emotes, smails, posts to
the board, profiles, you name it!  What you may be wondering though is how you
get to use all these colours... Well, here's how...

Each colour has a code associated with it, and each of these codes starts with
a ~.  You can combine different codes so that you get different effects on the
colours, for instance, you may use the code for red text, with the code for
bold text and a code for green background (no one said it wasn't going to
clash!).  All you have to do is include these codes in whatever text you are
writing, be it normal chat, a message to the board, an smail, or whatever.

The codes for the text colour are:

    ~~RSFK - black,         ~~RSFR - red,       ~~RSFG - green,
    ~~RSFY - yellow,        ~~RSFB - blue,      ~~RSFM - magenta,
    ~~RSFT - turquoise,     ~~RSFW - white

The codes for the background colour are:

    ~~RSBK - black,         ~~RSBR - red,       ~~RSBG - green,
    ~~RSBY - yellow,        ~~RSBB - blue,      ~~RSBM - magenta,
    ~~RSBT - turquosse,     ~~RSBW - white

The codes for other text effects are:

    ~~RSOL - bold,          ~~RSLI - blinking,  ~~RSRV - reverse

    (note that on some terminals blinking text may just be bold)

To reset to normal text the code is:    ~~RSRS

If you are using colour in a tell, say, shout, etc, then you do not need to
use the reset code at the end of the text, but you do need to use the reset
code if you are using colour in an smail, message post, suggestion, etc.

Example of how to use the colour codes...

For this example let use assume you are just saying something.  You would type
the text in like:

    say ~~RSFBHi!~~RSRS  I can ~~RSFTnow~~RSRS talk in ~~RSFRdifferent~~RSRS ~~RSBBcolours~~RSRS!!!!!

which would result in: (you can only see this is you have colour on)

    say ~FBHi!~RS  I can ~FTnow~RS talk in ~FRdifferent~RS ~BBcolours~RS!!!!!

Mixing the codes would have an effect something like this:

    say Th~~RSFGis~~RSRS is j~~RSLIust~~RSRS to ~~RSBY~~RSFB~~RSOLsho~~RSBGw ~~RSFRyou~~RSRS.

    say Th~FGis~RS is j~LIust~RS to ~BY~FB~OLsho~BGw ~FRyou~RS.

It may seem a little confusing at first, but if you play around with them for
long enough you soon get the hang of talking in many colours...

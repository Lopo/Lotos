NUTS stands for Neils Unix Talk Server, a program which started out as a
university project in autumn 1992 and has progressed from thereon. In no
particular order thanks go to the following people who helped me develop or
debug this code in one way or another over the years:
   ~FTDarren Seryck, Steve Guest, Dave Temple, Satish Bedi, Tim Bernhardt,
   ~FTKien Tran, Jesse Walton, Pak Chan, Scott MacKenzie and Bryan McPhail.
Also thanks must go to anyone else who has emailed me with ideas and/or bug
reports and all the people who have used NUTS over the intervening years.
I know I've said this before but this time I really mean it - this is the final
version of NUTS 3. In a few years NUTS 4 may spring forth but in the meantime
that, as they say, is that. :)

If you wish to email me my address is '~FGneil@ogham.demon.co.uk~RS' and should
remain so for the forseeable future.

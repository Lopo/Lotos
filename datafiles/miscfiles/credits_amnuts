~OL~FTAmnuts version 2.2.1~RS, Copyright (C) Andrew Collington, 1999

Amnuts stands for ~OLA~RSndy's ~OLM~RSodified ~OLNUTS~RS, a Unix talker server written in C.
Thanks to Neil for the original NUTS code and Cygnus for his Ncohafmuta code.
Many thanks to Simon for the live account to test Amnuts on, for testing
code, and for pointing out errors (and for being my Best Man!).  Thanks as
well to Arny, Squirt, Canuck, Joey, Ziffnab, Xan, Karri, Rudder and others
for debugging, ideas, etc.  Thanks to everyone else as well, for ideas and
using Amnuts.
My fiancee, Lisa, and I are getting married on October 16th, 1999!  I'm
moving to the States to live, so for a while this will be the last version
of Amnuts.  But please keep visiting the website and supporting the code!
And on a personal note:  I love you, Lisa! :)
If you have any comments or suggestions about this code, then please feel
free to email me at ~OL~FTamnuts@iname.com~RS.  If you have a web broswer, then you
can see the Amnuts website which is at ~OL~FThttp://www.talker.com/amnuts/~RS
I hope you enjoy the talker!

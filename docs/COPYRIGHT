Copyright for Amnuts code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Amnuts code and files contain within the distribution are supplied as 
freeware and not public domain.  I retain the copyright for all files included 
with exception of: the ASCII picture files and any unmodified documentation 
written by Neil Robertson.  I will take legal action against anyone/company who
is found selling the code for their own commercial advantage, though if anyone 
wishes to run a pay-to-use talker using the Amnuts code then they are welcome.
If you wish to distribute the original Amnuts code to anyone else this must be 
done with my express permission.
You are free to modify the Amnuts code anyway you wish to suit your own needs 
and distribute that.  You must not alter the .version, or the version
prompt when logging in so much that it does not refer to the code being based
on Amnuts or that the code isn't 100% original.  You must also leave the
credits from Neil and myself in the code (viewed by '.help credits'), and
also the header information at the top of the source code.
Although every care has been taken to produce a bug-free talker system, this
distribution is supplied as-is and I cannot be held responsible for damages
incurred through any use of the Amnuts code or any other associated files.
This copyright pertains to ANY version of Amnuts, documents, or web site.
If you have any problems with this copyright notice then you should not use the
code at all.

Copyright for NUTS code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you alter the code could you please leave the credits in the code (.help
credits) and also don't change the version so much that it doesn't say NUTS
anymore when a user does the .version command. I find it annoying that after 
I've spent months of time working on this software someone comes along, changes
a few commands then pretends its all their own work. If you have a problem 
with any references to my name or the NUTS name being in your talker then 
don't use my software, its that simple, go write your own from scratch. 
This software is freeware, it is *NOT* public domain, I retain copyright, and 
since there is code in here that I have used in a commercial system I have 
written I will take legal action on anyone and their institution/employer who 
I find using it to their own commercial advantage by way of selling the code
of either this or a modified version. I have no problems with anyone running a 
pay-to-use talker using NUTS however.
You are perfectly free to modify the code to suit your needs and distribute 
modified versions *BUT* if you do could you please leave my name, the NUTS
name and the code header in the code and also note the fact that the code
isn't 100% original.

Copyright pre Crypt v5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Working from Neil's license it follows that the Crypt talker coder is freeware
and my be freely modified and distributed AS LONG AS:

1)  All of Neil's requests above are obeyed, with the additions that the 
.version command (including the one at login prompt) mentions that the talker 
is based on CryptCode as well as Nuts.  

2) My credits (.help credits) are retained as are Neil's credits (.help neil).

3) This code is never to be sold or passed off as anyone else's work.

Also, if the code IS modified and redistributed it would be nice if you include
a file summarising the changes made.

This package also includes code written from scratch by me (ncat, userinfo) 
and this is again freeware which may be freely modified and redistributed as 
long as my credits remain in the code. 

Portions of the freeware package Figlet v2.1.1 by Glenn Chappell and Ian Chai 
have been used. 

The GNU implementation of the Unix system call crypt() by Michael Glad  is 
included here to provide support for MS-Windows and FreeBSD compilations.

It would also be nice if you included a small note on either the MOTD1 or MOTD2 file
saying that the talker is based on Crypt code.  (Unlike Simon Marsh I won't insist
on this ;)

By using this code you agree to all the following terms and conditions. These
terms and conditions supercede any others that may have been imposed by
previous versions of the code that were released unless otherwise stated.

i) This code is in *NO* way supported by anybody who has ever coded
it. You use it entirely at your own risk, and in doing so agree to indemnify
ALL the people who have contributed coding time against any proceedings that
may result due to the use or misuse of this code. We are *NOT* responsible!

ii) The code is provided on an 'as is' basis. It is not guaranteed to work, or
not to. This could mean it will completely screw up the machine you run it on.
Don't come crying to anyone, we're NOT responsible.

iii) Feel free to redistribute the code. BUT please include all the files, and
make clear any changes you have made to them. By preference point people to
where you got this from, so they can have an unadulterated copy, (that, or YOU
are responsible for any questions they may ask).

iv) You MUST give credit to the following people in your message of the day,
(and must always include something like a message of the day for this purpose).

       Wayne Owens - aka Pendragon the originator of the code

v) In a 'help credits' or similar you must also mention the following people:

       Wayne Owens (Pendragon) - the originator of the code
       Colin May        (Rael) - Code Tester.
       Trefor Southwell (tref) - The person who came up with the idea for
				 a NEW talker Base code.
       
(basically you just need to give credit where credit is due)
You may of course credit the entire lot in your message of the day as well,
but you'll end with a rather large one *8-P.

Copyright pre Moenuts 1.59
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using this software is subject to the following agreements and 
restrictions.  Please read and make sure you understand them before using
this software.  Alot of time and effort by Moesoft developments with the
help of others went into making this Talker Server happen, and we'd like
to be able to keep up the development of this.


1... This licence agreement may be updated without notice.  The latest
     We reserve the right to update this agreement without notification in
     any way we see fit.

2... No user shall remove code from the product in question for the
     purpose of using it in another product/code without the
     written concent of Moesoft Developments.  Keep in mind, we do
     release usefull code snippets on our FTP site, and you never know,
     the code you're looking for must might be there anyways:).

3... All copyright notices MUST remain intact.  No one person shall modify
     the .version or .help credits in any way.  These must remain as they
     are.  No one person shall remove any of the names on the 'Special
     Thanks To' role call in the credits.  These people have been kind
     enough to donate their time and/or services and/or knowledge to help
     make this project better, and must not be removed from the list.

4... No one person using the Moenuts Chat Server may update it and call it
     their own.  We don't have a problem with you saying something like:
     Talker Name v2.2.2 running Moenuts v1.59 or whatever.  As long as the
     Moenuts and the original NUTS version identifiers are left intact.
     It's very disturbing to see talker owners that run codes calling it
     their own code when all they did was modified a couple prompts and/or
     added a couple commands and say they wrote it.  There has been alot
     of work put into Moenuts from the original NUTS 3.3.3 release, not
     just a couple of commands or prompt changes.

5... No one person shall use any of Moesoft's Products for the purpose
     of making a profit off of it.  We don't make any money from it, so
     neither should you.  You may, however use the software to run a
     Pay-Per-Use system as long as it's not for commercial purposes.
     Commercial use is subject to a special agreement.  Please contact
     support@moesoft.8m.com for more information.

6... Moesoft products are distributed under their own agreements and are
     NOT released under the GNU licence agreement, nor are PUBLIC DOMAIN!
     Our products are either released under a Freeware agreement or a
     Shareware agreement (Specified in the documentation of each product).

7... Legal action can and may be persued against anyone ignoreing or
     disobeying the terms of this and other agreements set fourth by
     Moesoft Developments.

8... Current Copies Of This Agreement May Be Found On Our Website At:
